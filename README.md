Download the zip file, unzip &amp; setup like this:
1. Open xampp or wamp
2. Create a database named "hotel"
3. Select the database, go to SQL Tab and paste all text of "hotel.sql" in it. Now, hit "GO".
4. Now, if you're using wamp, go to "../wamp64/www/" and paste the full folder. Done! For xampp the directory is "../xampp/htdocs/".
5. Lastly, go to root folder, "../wamp64/www/hotel/" or "../xampp/htdocs/hotel" and open "db.php". You will find that server name is set to "localhost:3307". Edit is as your requirement. If you're using port 3306, use "localhost:3306" or simply "localhost". If you're using anything other than that type "localhost:XXXX" where "XXXX" denotes the port number of server.
6. Go to your browser & type: "localhost/hotel". Website will show up!
7. For visiting admin panel you'll need username & password. Username: "srizon" (without quote) &amp; Password: "srizon" (without quote).
